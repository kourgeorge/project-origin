## Artificial IQ
To validate the fit of creatures, and to test their intelligence development, we perform artificial iq test to a sample from the population and each time step.
The tests include creating states that the correct action to do is obvious or alternatively a specific action is clearly wrong.
Each test contains a state, the action to do or not to do and the test weight.
For instance, given that many enemy are around with no food, and there is a haven cell on the right with much food and no enemies, the creature must go to the right.
